## Best Practices

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Keep API endpoints thin
   - Business logic in services
   - Database queries in repositories/models

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Use environment variables
   - Separate configs for dev/prod
   - Never commit secrets

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use custom exceptions
   - Return consistent error responses
   - Log errors appropriately

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Mock external services

5. **Documentation**
   - Document complex logic
   - API documentation (OpenAPI)
   - README files for setup
